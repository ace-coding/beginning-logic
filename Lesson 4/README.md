# Logic: Lesson 4

1. Starts class by playing couple rounds of Simon says  **(3:30 - 3:40)**                 

2. Recover memory from long time ago the importance of order in commands. 
    Discuss lists of command “Daniel” can have - write it on the board. Include object of the game. (Give.them prompts, goals, etc)
    “Slap, touch, roll, dance, left, right, move, etc" into actions  **(3:40 - 3:45)**
	- Play in action **(3:45 - 4:05)**

3. The teacher shows (physically) everyone a motion. Example would be like the teacher dances in certain ways. And kids have to figure out what he/she is doing using commands. **(4:05 - 4:10)**

4. It’s their turn. Each requires paper, pencil and each of them has to present their "Motion/dance/skit" using 5 actions. They should submit the paper with clear 5 actions and present in front of us. **(4:10- 4:28)**

5. Recap what they have learned **(4:28 - 4:30)**
