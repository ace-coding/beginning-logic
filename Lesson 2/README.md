# Logic: Lesson 2

## Preparation
 - Each table should have 4 chairs 
 - Each table has a set of blocks (move 1 step, turn left, turn right, repeat, put beeper), karl-the-robot grid drawn on half of table, and figurine, and bingo circles
 - Two tables on the side, one with launcher (Joan’s) and the other with cups, empty glue sticks, figurines (if possible)

## Introduction
 - Introduce yourself (name, favorite movie) to your new group

## Launcher (10 mins each rotation, 5 rotations)
Goal: to get the most points possible
Rotation: One group of 4, while other groups work on another challenge
1. (To all at start of class, 5 min) Show teams how the missile launcher works.
2. (2 min) Have team put up cups/ glue sticks strategically  
3. (5 min) Tell team to write commands to get the most points with 4 missiles. (Ex: Right 3 Clicks, Down 1 Click, Shoot)
4. (2 min) Have one of the teachers follow the “code” of team and keep track of score. 
5. (1 min) Explain afterwards that this is part of programming logic: we have to make the code easy to follow for the user, because we aren’t around to tell them what to do! 
6. Rotate

## Square/Diamond
 - Using the blocks, make code to make the figurine draw out a square on the grid.
 - Teacher calls out different numbers to see if their code works with every number.
 - Introduce the concept of variables (a letter or word in place of a number): Ask if anyone already knows what a variable is, then explain.
 - Using blocks, make code to make figurine draw a diamond on the grid.

## Blockly
Go up to Level 5.
